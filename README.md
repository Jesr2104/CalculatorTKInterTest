# CalculatorTKInterTest

The app you described is a Python application that utilizes the TkInter library to create a user interface for a calculator. The TkInter library is a built-in Python library that provides a set of tools for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) using the Tk GUI toolkit.

The app's purpose is to test the capabilities of the TkInter library by building a user interface that allows users to perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The interface includes elements such as buttons for numbers and mathematical operations, labels to display the results of calculations, and a text box to input numbers.

The app will be written using object-oriented programming principles, with classes and methods being used to organize the code and separate the concerns of the different elements of the interface. The app will also make use of event-driven programming, where the app will respond to user interactions with the interface, such as button clicks or menu selections.

Overall, this app aims to provide a demonstration of the capabilities of the TkInter library for creating a simple calculator, serving as an example of how to create user interfaces with Python.
